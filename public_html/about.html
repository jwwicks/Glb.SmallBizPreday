		<h1>About SMB Preday</h1>
		<p>SMB Preday is a free community resource developed and maintained by <a href="http;//smbbooks.com/">SMB Books</a> and <a href="http://greatlittlebook.com/">Great Little Book Publishing Co., Inc</a>. These are the web sites I use to promote books and other resources for the SMB Conulting community.</p>
		<h2>What&#39;s a &quot;Preday?&quot;</h3>
		<p>Many years ago, <em>Harry Brelsford</em> rented a hotel room at the site of the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference. He 
			put on an event just for SMB Consultants. A whole day of activities. Because it was as close as possible to the WPC events, he attracted 
			a lot of people who were in town for the WPC.</p>
			<p>And thus the &quot;preday&quot; event was born.</p>
			<p>In fall of 2005, I help my first preday event on 
			the site of SMB Nation. We had a room set for 115. People were 
			packed in that room and hanging out in the hallway. Not sure how 
			many people we had total. Every year since then I&#39;ve held a preday 
			event for SMB Nation, and got at least 120 attendees.</p>
			<p>Now, in 2008, there are lots of people doing 
			preday events for a variety of conferences. I&#39;ve scheduled events 
			with with Erick Simpson, Matt Makowicz, Robin Robins, Amy Luby, and 
			others. These are great educational opportunities -- and a lot of 
			fun! </p>
			<p>Plan to attend a conference. Look me up when you 
			get there!</p>

		<h3>Meet Lana</h3>
			<p>The hard work on these pages is done by Svetlana 
			Shurayev. Lana gathered the information about the hotels and created 
			the maps.</p>
			<p>You should also know that Lana&#39;s the one who 
			packages your books when you place an order. She also prints name 
			badges for events, keeps track of inventory, and does pretty much 
			everything else needed to make Great Little Book run smoothly.</p>
